### Day 00: October 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days Of Code.

**Thoughts:** I am Committing myself to the 100 Days of code challenge so that I can improve and gain more confidence in my skills as a developer. Throughout the next 100 days, I aim to finish some personal and work related projects, I am also hoping to meet and chat with other developers to encourage them in their challenges :)
